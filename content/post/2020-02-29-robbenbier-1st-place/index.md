I submitted four entires to the 25th CARBOY Shamrock Open XXV beer competition in Raleigh North Carolina.  For some reason only 3 of my entries arrived, the Trappist Single was *lost in transit* (must have been extra tasty).  That being said, the roggenbier I submitted took a First Place win in category with a score of *41*. 

Fingers crossed, this was also submitted to the National Homebrew Competitions as well as the Hamton Roads Virginia Beer Blitz!

Here are the specifics on this brew.

## Fermentation Profile

I use the tilt hydrometer so I can get an idea of how the fermentation process is proceeding.  Here is the output.
