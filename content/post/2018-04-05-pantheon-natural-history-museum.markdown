In the afternoon, we thought we would get a bit of energy by eating too much good food... then go on a bit of a walk to see a few of the more scale-defying items on our list. We started on the Île Saint Louis with lunch at La Chaumière

For a pot of mussels & fries.  OMG these were tasty.

There was a little man on the bridge just outside the door playing his accordion for us...

And a mallard and drake begging for bread crumbs (we imagined they were named Gusto and Genevieve and he was rather brave to fight off the pigeons to let her get the best bread crumbs).

We then walked across and up to the Pantheon. I’ve only been to visit this place in the Winter & Spring and it is always chilly. I suspect that in the tombs below it is even a bit chilly in the heat of the summer given all that stone around. As soon as you walk in the door, here is Saint Denis again, picking up his head and getting ready for the ‘long walk.’

The scale of this place is amazing.

Under the pantheon is a crypt for the luminaries of French Society including Voltaire, Victor Hugo, and Marie Curie.

Next, we passed by the remains of the Roman Collusium, Arenses de Lutece. Today, instead of gladiators and epic drama, there were some old guys playing Bacchi ball (?) and school kids climbing the scaffolding

From here, it is a short 5 minute walk to the Jardin does Plantes and the Galerie de Paléontologie et d’Anatomie comparée.

The scale of this building and the context within which its inhabitants exist is difficult to get a good idea with any kind of photography. So, I will do what is easy and just throw a bunch of pictures up and explore you to go visit this location yourself.

At the end of the day, Elizabeth had had enough walking and looking and we were ready for a nice dinner and an early night. We all felt the same, so much to take in, so many stairs...
