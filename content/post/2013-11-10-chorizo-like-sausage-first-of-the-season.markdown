OK, after a long summer with a warm and moist garage, it is finally time for the salchichador!
So for this year, I'm starting of with a pseudo chorizo. My friend Christina is going to argue that this is not real chorizo, as in Spanish chorizo, and she would be exactly correct. These are usual fermented sausages and I'm not quite ready for this (a few updates to the sausage chamber first). However, it is also different than the Mexican chorizo, which is often much more wet. This is a blend of the two styles, and a starting point for a new recipe.
Here are the ingredients.
  * 3# Pork Shoulder.
  * 1# Fatback 
  * 2T Smoked Spanish paprika
  * 3T Hot Turkish paprika
  * 1t Red pepper flakes
  * 1t Marjoram leaves
  * 1T Kosher salt
  * 3/4t #1 Curing salt
  * 2 2/3T cumin seeds
  * 2 1/2T fresh yellow onion
  * 3T fresh minced garlic
  * 2 1/4t Sherry vinegar
  * 2t olive oil
I trim out the coppa from a Boston But and use the rest for the meat. Cut into 1" chunks and put in the freezer for 30 minutes to get a bit harder and easier to use. I cut the fatback by hand to have much cleaner separation between the mean and fat.

Heat a saut√© pan and throw in the oil and cook the garlic and onions until the onions just start to get translucent. Addthe paprikas, pepper, cumin seeds, cinnamon, cloves, cloves, and sherry and reduce the heat to low. This will form a paste if you throw in a few chugs of the dry red wine. Don't put too much in, you'll have to reduce it too long. Spread it out and cook for a few minutes until it darkens a bit. Remove from heat and spread it out thinly on a sheet of foil to cool quickly.

Mix the pork cubes and the seasoning and put through the meat grinder. I have a KitchenAid attachment that I use and I typically use the largest plate to grind. If it looks a bit too dry, feel free to throw a few glugs of dry red wine in there to get it mixed up.

Store the mixture for 48 hours in the fridge in a non-reactive bag. I use one of those huge ziplocks (the 2.5 gallon ones).
