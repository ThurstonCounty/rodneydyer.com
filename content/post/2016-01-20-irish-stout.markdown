The most common thing I hear when I offer someone a stout is, “I don’t like dark beers…”  I think this is mostly because there is only one dark beer the average American has ever tried—and this is usually with Corned Beef and Cabbage on St. Patricks day _en route_ to a hangover—is Guiness Stout.  

The Irish Stout style (2015 BJCP Style 15B) is defined as:  
<blockquote>A black beer with a pronounced roasted flavor, often similar to coffee. The balance can range from fairly even to quite bitter, with the more balanced versions having a little malty sweetness and the bitter versions being quite dry. Draught versions typically are creamy from a nitro pour, but bottled versions will not have this dispense- derived character. The roasted flavor can be dry and coffee-like to somewhat chocolaty.</blockquote>

This style has a wide range of flavors; “even to bitter”, “malty sweetness to bitter versions being quite dry”, and  “dray and coffee-like to somewhat chocolaty”  

This version is one that is balanced and not excessively dry recipe.  The mash consist of:

7.25# Pale 2-Row  
1.75# Flaked Barley  
0.40# Carapils/Dextrine

Which was mashed at 154F for 60 minutes.  When it was towards the end, I added the dark malts before a recirculation mash to clear up the wort. During this vorlof stage, I added

0.75# Crystal 80  
0.75# Roasted Barley  
0.40# Debittered Black Malt.

and recirculated for 15 minutes.  I then batch sparged in two sessions of 168F water.

I boiled for 60 minutes and added 

38g Challenger Hops @ 60  
1 tablet Whirlflock @ 5  
1 tsp Yeast Nutrient @ 5

At the end of the boil, I cooled using an infusion chiller (the plate chiller is just too much of a pain to clean) and pitched a 2L Starter of

Wyeast 1028 London Ale Yeast 

and fermented @ 64 for 3 weeks.  Afterwards, I transferred to a keg, crashed it, carbed it, and drank it.  

It was perhaps the most smooth stout I’ve made.  I would really love to try this one on nitrogen.
