A day of oppulence for both mind and sight.

## Musée du Louvre

We were lucky enough to get into le Louvre this morning before the lines got too bad. We jumped onto a “Rick Steves” (he’s from the PNW you know) audio guided tour on Apple Podcasts and it was great. Just enough commentary (bad jokes) and directions to allow us to navigate through the morning and into lunch time looking at the a selection of the antiquities, Greek, Roman, Italian, and French halls.

This place is HUGE. It would take you a month to see it all, so you have to be selective and go in with a plan.

I’ll spare you the gory details, but in all, it was astounding! The structure itself is a mashup of many palaces, each connected by successive monarchs. And along with this, there is an odd mix of different styles and epocs.

The classic Greeks really showed where it all came from.

With, of course this one stealing the show.

I can give or take the art of the Middle Ages (mostly give and not take). But the stuff after that period was interested in their own ways.

In particular, I’m a big fan of this one by Andrea Mantegna (1431-1506).

These more contemporary works are spectacular. I love the one with on the bottom right depicting the young woman how had just gotten stung by a scorpion. The marble is so thin between her toes, light comes through like tissue paper (and the scorpion is still there yet to be smashed).

You can really out do it in this Museum. Pace yourself and set goals. It is a place that you can spend a lifetime exploring.

## The Opera House

    The French National Academy of Music
After that, we decided to go to the Opera House. It was perhaps the most opulent place (besides Versailles) that I know of. We got a tour guide who showed us all the back rooms, we were able to go onto the floor and see the stage, and peek into Box #5 where the Phantom of the Opera is said to still haunt.

This tour is definitely worth it. If you have a few extra hours, splurge for this one.

## Dinner at Bofinger

To round out the day, we took the Metro to Bastille and went to the famous Bofinger for dinner.

    We had the corner table no less.
The food was excellent. Sarah wanted to drink the hollindaise sauce and I tried my best to finish one of their signature dinners, sourkraut and a melange of sausages...  We were all quite quiet on the Metro back to our hotel and are still recovering.
