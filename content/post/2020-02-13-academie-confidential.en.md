The book *Kitchen Confidential* was a really eye-opener for me.  Not in terms of the individual himself, but in how he created it as an *in-your-face* rebuke of the industry within which he lived that focused on uncovering the real nature of the job and the often fucked up personalities of the individuals who enhabited it.  That is inspiring to me and I hope to patch together something, though much more restricted in both size and audience, myself.  However, this is about academic life.  Hence, *Academie Confidential*. 

As a first pass, I think I'll begin by collecting blog posts under a [unifying tag](https://thurstoncounty.gitlab.io/tags/academie-confidential/) on this site.
