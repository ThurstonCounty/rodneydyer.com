This was an absolutely wonderful day in Edinburgh.  Sunny and beautiful and my girls came into town, a bit bedraggled, but in high spirits as they always are.  Such great travel companions.  

I picked them up from the airport and then we walked around a bit while waiting for the AirB&B to open up.  Such a cute flat!  If only it was closer to Edinburgh Castle...

After relaxing a bit, we went out to enjoy the afternoon light.  The daffodils on the north slope of the castle are absolutely at peak bloom.  The April light is right there and it was perfect.

The first day after a trans-Atlantic flight is always a tough time.  They got through it no problem.  Gonna get a long nights sleep and then storm the castle in the morning.
