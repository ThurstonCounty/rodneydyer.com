Last weekend, I went to Costco and picked up a pair of pork butts to cut out some coppa's (I'll post later about these). Today I used the remaining parts of the butts to make some brats for tonights dinner (this post) and a redo of some [longaniza](http://pork-curious.tumblr.com/post/36587418375/longaniza-first-time-round-the-recipe-for-this) (though a bit more spicy this time).
I wanted to do 5# of the cured sausage and we only needed a few links for us and a gift for my friends Fernando & Christina so what follows is the amount used for 2# of pork/fatback.
  * 2# pork shoulder (trimmed) + fatback (portions from the hard fat on the butts and the rest from fatback provided by my all-time favorite [butcher](http://www.belmontbutchery.com/)).
  * 1/2# bacon (yes bacon added to the mix of sausage, hate me if you can).
  * 2t salt (I used table salt this time)
  * 1 1/2T minced garlic
  * 3/4t white pepper
  * 3/4t marjoram
  * 3/4t sage
  * 1/3C milk (I know, this sounds odd)
  * 1 egg (it gets better)
  * 2t dry white wine
So I ground up the meat with the fatback first using the course grinding plate on myKitchen-aid. I wish Icould find that older, more corse plate (at least I have the racing red one). Make sure you keep the grind as cold as possible (here it is sitting with some Sierra Nevada and some old-school Tecate).

Then I mixed in the bacon (cut into bits) and the dry ingredients and reground it using the small plate. Using the mixer, I mixed in the wet stuff (scramble the egg in the milk first) for 1 minute and then stuffed it into hog casings.

**Brats & Beans**
**  
**So this time, I'm going to also include how I served these brats. Here I relied upon a simple recipe that lets the sausage showcase its own subtile flavors. Here is a simple thing that does a great job for dinner along with a little fresh French bread.
  * 5 links of the sausage above
  * 4 cloves of garlic
  * 3T olive oil
  * 2 cans Cannellini Beans
  * 1C apple cider
  * 4 sage leaves (roughly torn)
  * fresh pepper to taste
Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Take the brats and puncture them all over with a fork. Add the garlic and the oil and put them in the oven for 20 minutes. After that, turn the sausages and add the rest of the ingredients. Put them back into the oven for another 20 minutes or at least until the beans are cooked (though not too much so that they crack open). Pull it from the oven, let it cool a bit and then enjoy. If you are lucky, you can see a bean or two wave at you (they split and move as they cool), just don't let it be too many.

BonAperitif. If you pair it with a bit of bubbly cider (Crispin in the can or Strongbow are my favorite), it makes a great meal.
