Much of these were harvest from [Atlas Obscura](https://www.atlasobscura.com/), a great resource to learn about new and interesting places. We've gone through their list of locations in and around Paris and picked out some of the ones we may be interested in visiting on our upcoming trip.

So there are just too many things to do while in Paris. However, I'm trying to get some of the options put down and available so that if we are_en route_ to some destination, we can not miss out on something. As we go through the trip, we'll update the individual daily logs of our exploits and provide more information on where we go and what we see.
