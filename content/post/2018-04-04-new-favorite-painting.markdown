We are wandering the Louvre today looking big at the Italian, French, Greek, and Roman wings. I found a great painting by [Andrea Montegna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Mantegna) called _Minerva chases the vices out of the garden of Virtue._ It has some great components.

You really have to get close to this to see the awesomeness of details.
