Today started a bit earlier—ok not that much, we did stay up until 23H at a cafe having a bit of wine. Today we wanted to get up to Montmartre and see Sacre Coeur and shop for art amongst what is left of the Bohemians.

We also went around the corner to the [Paroisse Saint-Pierre de Montmartre](http://www.saintpierredemontmartre.net). This is apparently the oldest continuously running church in Paris. This year, they are celebrating their 870th anniversary. Very cool. The church was built using some Roman columns dating back thousands of years.

The shops and artist stalls are wonderful. Had a great French onion soup and a glass of Grimbergen at Cadet de Gascogne.

Sarah found a water color painting she liked Place du Tertre.

We strolled a bit (the ladies had a gelato and a crape) and tried to go to the Salvadore Dali museum. Unfortunately, it was “closed for embellishments.” I cannot think of many other artists whose work does not need additional embellishments any less than Dali! Maybe next time.

We then did a lot of window shopping. Great little shops abound.

We found the Moulin de la Galette

![](/img/2018/04/2CC41558-AB0D-41EC-8FC5-B0A5A829155A.jpeg)
where [Renoir](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Auguste_Renoir) was said to have painted the [Bal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bal_du_moulin_de_la_Galette)[du moulin de la G](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bal_du_moulin_de_la_Galette)[alette](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bal_du_moulin_de_la_Galette)

    Bal du moulin de la Galette (in Musée de Orsay) which we will go see tomorrow.
We also tracked down the house of [Vincent van Gogh,](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh) where he lived with his brother Theo (and where he is supposed to have removed his own ear). Will be checking in on his paintings tomorrow as well.

    The house of Van Gogh.
Had a coffee (Elizabeth is getting hooked on real good European coffee) at La Consulat. Great place to ‘people watch’ as well.

Down the hill, we found the love wall

    The love wall
and a place that Sarah and Claire went to as youngsters back in the 90’s. Unfortunately, it was closed as the Monday after Easter is kind of a holiday here. Apparently, this fondue place serves people wine in baby bottles... (?).

We ended going back to Île de la Cité for dinner. We found this little hole in the wall—literally, and if you go to the bathroom in the basement where the kitchen is, it is essentially a cave dug out of the rock of Pont Neuf—called Ma Salle à Manger in Place Dauphine. Baked Camembert with honey and thyme, a nice glass of Bordeaux, and Elizabeth and I split a steak frites... The end to a great day of sights.  __
