I started this one because I love the taste of lamb. I know it isn't pork but perhaps it can be given an honorary status on this blog. Fluffy young pork, perhaps? I just love good lamb and I picked up a leg at Costco for dinner (braised with some turnips & parsnip with a Malbec reduction…) and thought it would be fun to do a few pieces of proscuitto. I'd love to get a few of these under my belt and do a goat leg…
In the following, the percentages are based upon the total weight of the lamb.
  * Leg of lamb (actually 2 pieces): 768g
  * 3.8% Kosher salt
  * 3% Sugar
  * 1.4% Black pepper
  * 1% Rosemary (fresh & finely chopped)
  * 0.5% Juniper berries (crushed & finely chopped).
  * Cure #2 as per instructions.

In preparing the meat, you must be very careful to trim **all** the silver skin, excess fat, etc. The whole leg I used was about 4.5# but I used only 1.7 of it for this. 
After, mixing these up, I rubbed all over the two pieces. Rub it in really well then put the leg and all the rub into a vacuum bag and put it in the fridge for a week or two. I like to put the weights on the bag itself so I have easy access to them as I go forward.

Check back in a few weeks and we'll see how it goes.
