## **Greyfriars**

This is kind of a famous locale for two reasons. First, the story of Greyfriars Bobby, a terrier who supposedly went to his deceased owners grave, every day, for 14 years.

It is also kind of famous because of Harry Potter, whose author borrowed some of the names from the graveyard here to include in the story including Tom Riddle, and Macgonagal. It also has some pretty cool tombs as well.

## Old Friends

We finished the day out meeting up with some old friends, Juan & Murielle. They just happened to be visiting Edinburgh this week too. It was great, Juan had never met Elizabeth and hadn't seen Sarah since graduate school.
