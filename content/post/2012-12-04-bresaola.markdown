Almost finished with the curing chamber (a post to appear when I get it together) so I thought I would start something that needed it in a week or two and ensure I finish up the project. I saw a nice write-up on:
[http://curedmeats.blogspot.com/2007/11/bresaola.html](http://curedmeats.blogspot.com/2007/11/bresaola.html)
and thought I would give it a try. The general gist is to cure the meat for 15-21 days in salt/cure/herbs in the fridge and then put it in a casing and dry it for a month or so (actually it is weight based).
Here is my herb rub. The items are based as a fraction of the weight of the meat so you'll have to adjust it for your own . My scale is not that sensitive so some of the measurements were 'winged' a bit.
  * Eye of Round
  * Kosher salt 5%
  * Sugar 1%
  * Black Pepper 0.5%
  * Fresh Rosemary 0.25%
  * Juniper Berries 0.10 %
  * Dry Thyme 0.10 %
  * Cinnamon 0.05%
  * Clove 0.025%
  * Cure #2 (after manufacturers instructions).
Mix these up and put aside as you remove ALL the fat and silverskin on the meat. Be vicious about it. I then rubbed the herbs into the meat like I was a high-end masseur(HT to the bro-in-law!).
I then put it (and the left over rub) into a vacuume sealed bag and off to the fridge. Starting weight 1505g.

Off to the fridge for a couple of weeks. Make sure to turn it, rub it, love it (and name it Georgeâ€¦).
