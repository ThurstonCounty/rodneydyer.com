Call me old school, call me whatever.  If I have my druthers among the cornucopia of IPA styles these days, I kick it old school.  A moderately strong, hoppy & estery beer, with crystal malt and some grapefruit, pine, melon tastes.  The West Coast IPA.  

I've just switched over to the Tilt hydrometer and hooked up automatic data logging for the fermentation using an old iPad in the garage.  Along with the glycol chiller, this is a pretty sweet setup.

Here is my house recipe 

and the fermentation profile.
