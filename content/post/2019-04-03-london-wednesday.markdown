Afternoon in London, we got in around 3 and dropped off the bags at the B&B. It is an odd one. There is literally a shed in the flat

Which is currently housing the girls!

To get some sight seeing in, we walked down to the Thames and viewed the following.

We then crossed the river and went into Borough Market (it was closing).

Then it started raining so we popped into a pub and had a pint and some meat pies.
