When you are ready to stuff these, mix the fatback into the mixture and then stuff them into pork casings. I like to take a bit of it and make a quick patty in to try out to ‘see if it needs more seasonings’ but this is more of an excuse for me to try it than anything else. You will need about 7 feet of pig casings, thoroughly washed..

After stuffing, I did a cold-smoke of 4 hours on a mix of oak & cherry and then hang in the garage curing chamber for a few weeks. I’ll add some pictures later.
