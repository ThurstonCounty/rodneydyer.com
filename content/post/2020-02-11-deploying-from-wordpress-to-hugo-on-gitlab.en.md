This is a moderatly interesting proposal. The main things that I've been dealing with are:  
 - Getting crap out of WordPress.  My old site is being hosted by an outside provider and I thought I'd pick up a new static site using [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) since they allow private repositories without paying.  
 - Getting things configured properly for static hosting and Continuous Integration.  This is a very nice thing &trade;
 - Getting bigimg + baseurl stuff fixed so I can have top images on the posts.
 - Figuring out how to be able to post from ipad if I'm on the road.
