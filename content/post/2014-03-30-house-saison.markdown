This is a nice and easy Saison to make in preparation for summer. Work hard to make sure you ferment this baby up towards the top of the yeast range, it will impart a lot more off and funky characteristics.
All Grain Recipe:
  * 8.5# Belgian Pilsner (2-Row; 2.0 SRM)
  * 1.5# White Wheat Malt (2.4 SRM)
  * 0.5# Caramunich Malt (56.0 SRM)
  * 0.5# Flaked Oats (1 SRM)
  * 0.5oz Fuggles (60 minute)
  * 0.5oz Sorachi Ace (60 minute)
  * 0.5oz Fuggle (30 min)
  * 1.0oz Fuggle (15 min)
  * 1.5t Fresh White Pepper (ground)
  * 1# Honey (fresh)
  * Wyeast 3711 French Saison (mix up 1L starter)
Estimated OG: 1.059, FG: 1005,37.2 IBU, 4.7% ABV, 6.2 SRM.
In my setup, 10gal igloo MLT, 10gal HLT, 10gal BK, I did a single influsion mash @ 148 for 75 minutes with 4.19gal water. After vorloff, batch sparging with 1.13 & 4.0 gal of water. Boiled for 60 minutes. Fermentation was aided by heat (67 for primary, raised to mid-seventies and the 3711 found a little more to work on). Secondary @ 65 for 30 days, bare minimum! This is delicious at 2 months. I kegged at 2.8 vol CO2.
