    If you get a chance, go here.
There are those twanky little stores that you find in various cities. Some have interesting books, some have art that is ‘off the beaten path’ in various ways, and some are just magnificent in their own right. Today, we went to a place that I can honestly say is one of my favorite places even though I am unable to actually purchase anything there. It is called [Deyrolle](https://www.deyrolle.com).

This is a store that is set on an offshoot of Boulevard Saint-Germani, a few blocks up from [Café](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Café_de_Flore)[ de Flore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Café_de_Flore) and [Les](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Deux_Magots)[ Deux Magots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Deux_Magots)(two historically interesting eateries which are now quite expensive). From the street, it really looks like a garden shop.But if you back up, it occupies the complete second floor of the building.

The problem with telling you about this store is that they forbid any imagery. So, the pictures below are from their official site. Let’s just say that this is the place where you could finish out your ‘eclectic curio cabnet’ with just about anything you would want to. I saw a huge number of things here with official [CITES](https://www.cites.org/eng) permits attached, which suggests to me that there are items here that may not be able to be brought across some international borders without a heap of official paperwork involved!

Makes me want to start putting together a “curio cabinet” myself. My meager plant and insect collections have a lot of potential for more interesting display beyond being stuck in plant presses and bug boxes. 

The most outrageous thing I saw was a stuffed dodo with documentation, for a cool 18,000€ no less!
