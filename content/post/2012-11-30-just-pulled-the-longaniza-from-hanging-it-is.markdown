Just pulled the Longaniza from hanging. It is rather dry and not as spicy as I would have liked but tastes great. Iâ€™ll have to mix this up with some kielbasa for the Seahawks game on Sunday.

_Notes for Next Time:_

	  * Hickory may have been too strong of a smoke for 4 hours. Either reduce the time or mix in a more subtile wood.
	  * Add more heat to it, not spicy enough.
	  * Weigh before and after.
