After 18 days curing, I pulled out the lamb proscuitto out, rinsed it off and hung them up to dry. There are two pieces here, one weighing 548g and the other 259g. These are pretty small units, so it may not take too long loose 30% of their weight (~383g & 181g respectively).
Here they are hanging and drying in the garage prior to entering the chamber. I thought about tying them up but figured a single loop should be sufficient. We'll see.
