So today was a bit of the enigmatic tourist kind of day. We purchased a hop-on-hop-off ticket to one of those double decker bus companies and jumped on to go see stuff around the city. The morning was a bit rainy, so it was a pretty good idea.

## The Rainy Tourbus Ride

We did the "_Red Line_" on this tour.

While the rain on the windscreen was hampering good shots, the heater on the feet was comforting.

## Wellington Barracks

The mounted guard at Wellington Barracks was just changing over when we got there. Interesting to see it in action. As prior cavalry scout myself, it looks like a real pain in the butt to be dealing with the public so close, these young men are real professionals.  The Dragon Cannon is actually called the "Prince Regent's Bomb" and was created in celebration of the Siege of Cadiz in 1587.

Here is a movie of the process of the change.  These horses do not look that friendly to me.

Changing of the mounted guard at Wellington Barracks.  Love the sign on the right talking about the friendliness of the steeds!

## Buckingham Palace & St James Park

The Queen was not in residence today—apparently our travel plans didn't make it all the way here.  We walked through St. James Park and there were a lot of great foul there.

## Westminster Abbey

Outside the Abbey is crazy with a ton of tourists all around.

Here are some of the smaller stoneworks surrounding the east entrance.  I always appreciate the little details that the laborers put into these huge buildings.

Inside it was very nice. Very cramped compared to Notre Dame in Paris but literally [chocked full of dead bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burials_and_memorials_in_Westminster_Abbey).

Here is an example of the floor in what they call the "Poet's Corner."

The Poet's Corner

Inside you are not supposed to take pictures, I slipped the following two because it was Darwin

And because of the window (not doing it justice here but I was seated behind this class of students).

There was a statue in one of the side chapels that I wanted to image as well but knew it would be available externally. This is Lady Elizabeth & Joseph Nightingale, where Joseph is trying to protect Elizabeth from the arrow of death (emerging literally from the tomb below).

Sculpture of Elizabeth & Joseph Nightingale sculpted by Louis-François Roubiliac in 1761.

Outside the main part, there was the Cloisters, which you can take pictures.  Here are a bunch more people interred in the flooring.  The vivid green of the grass was striking after spending so much time looking at drab marble and stone fascades.

## Covent Gardens

We finished up the day doing some shopping and eating.

Bunbun, an interesting place with some really good steamed buns.

Ahhh, a pint of the Daymer Extra Pale Ale.  It was OK.
