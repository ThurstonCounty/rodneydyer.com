OK, so here is another go around at the longaniza recipe. I am doing two different things with this batch.
  1. I’m kicking up the heat bytriplingthe amount of crushed red peppers. I don’t know if this is enough but if not, I’ll augment the next time around with someCheyennepepper.
  2. I’m switching the smoking around a bit. [Last time](http://pork-curious.tumblr.com/post/36587418375/longaniza-first-time-round-the-recipe-for-this), I used hickory for the smoke but it was a bit too much so this time I’m going to mix up the kind of wood and give it a longer and slower smoke.
The recipe is the same as before (except for the crushed pepers). I also used a bit more authentic pork back this time around (a hunters fatback from Belmont Buchery). This recipe is:

  * 4# pork shoulder.
  * 1# fatback.
  * 2oz (this is a whole bottle) smoked Spanish Paprika.
  * 4T dry red Zinfandel (I used Ravenswood)
  * 2T white sugar
  * 2T kosher salt
  * 1T crushed pepper (I bumped this up 3x here)
  * 5 cloves garlic (chopped very fine)
  * 2t Marjoram (fresh if you have it)
  * water
  * 1t Pink Salt (#1)
For smoking this one, I opted to tone down the intensity of the wood but add a little longer smoking. The last few pieces of the [last batch](http://pork-curious.tumblr.com/post/36587418375/longaniza-first-time-round-the-recipe-for-this)actually mellowed out a bit and were quite good. I suppose it was a lot like smoked cheeses. So this time I fired up the cold smoker and got ready.

Inside the chamber, I had a fairly constant75°F. I held this for 6 hours of cold smoking using a mixture of hickory, cherry, apple wood. After that I jacked up the smoker to 180°F internal until I got a160°F point inside my test sausage.

This is what these little bitties looked liked after 6 hours of smoke and then the ramp up to an internal of 160°F. Essentially, I just cranked up the smoker to 180°F and waited until the internal was good. I think this was a bit too fast, these seem to have broken the fat given the shiny external appearance of the links. Maybe next time, I’ll be a bit slower on the ramp. In the morning I’ll weight each of them and then then put them up for a week or two of resting and drying out.
