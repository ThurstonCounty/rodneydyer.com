This day the bronchitis finally got ahold of me. Spent the whole morning finding a GP to get a prescription. Keeping the girls up way too much with the incessant coughing.

Finally got it all sorted and we left on a 2 hour train ride south, to the town of York.

Cutest town, with the old city inside the walls looks like this. Call it 'the Shambles'. Found a pub called the Botanist and we popped in for a pint.
